#Why doesn't converting a YAML file to a Python dictionary create a new file automatically?

#Imagine you have a book (the YAML file) and you read it to understand its content (you convert it to a Python
# #dictionary). This understanding of the book (the dictionary) now exists in your mind (your program's memory).
#However, you haven't written down that understanding in another book (a new file).

#To make an analogy with programming:

#YAML file: It's like a book written in a specific language (YAML) that contains organized information.
#Python dictionary: It's the representation of that information in your program's memory,
# in a data structure that Python understands.
#Creating a new file: Would be like writing a new book, but this time in the Python language (or in another format like JSON).
