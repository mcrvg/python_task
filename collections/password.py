# Create a program that is a mini password manager
# You will practice using dictionaries
# First, setup the ability for one user to login to the account manager using a username + password
username_enter=input("Enter your username")
password_enter=input("Enter your password")
# Once logged in, they should be able to store a usernames and passwords for different
username=username_enter
password=password_enter

#  accounts so they don't need to remember all their passwords
#  For example, for Facebook, email account, etc
facebook=[username,password]
print(facebook)

# Once the storage is setup, add the ability to add new users to the account manager
username_enter=input("Enter your username")
password_enter=input("Enter your password")

username2=username_enter=input("Enter your username")
password2=username_enter=input("Enter your username")
#  (they will each need a username + password)

# Add the ability to retrieve the username and password for a specific account
#  if they input the account name e.g. hotmail

# If time - Can you make it so you need to enter the user's password before they can change it to something else?
