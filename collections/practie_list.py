# Script should act like a waiter at a restaurant taking orders

# level 1
# Greet the user
print("Hello, good morning")

# Print a list of starters
starters=["garlic bread","olives","prawns"]
print("as started we have",starters)

# Take an input for the user for their starter
starter=input("What would you like as starter?")

# Print a list of mains
mains=["chicken","beef","fish"]
print("as main we have",mains)
# Take an input for the user for their main course
main=input("What would you like as main?")

# Print a list of desserts
desserts=["cheese cake","fruit","ice cream"]
print("for dessert we have",desserts)
# Take an input for the user for their dessert
dessert=input("any dessert?")
# Print all of the user's choices
print("The guess order as starter", starter,"as main", main, "and for dessert", dessert)

# level 2
# Use at least one f-string

# Add each item ordered to a list called 'customer_order_list'
customer_order_list=["starter","main","dessert"]
print(customer_order_list)

# level 3 (may need research if we have not covered dictionaries yet)
# Use dictionaries and assign prices to the items. Create a bill at the end of the program.

# level 4
# Add more to this program. Recommended ways are: Only allow input that is within the list, Add quantities of order etc.
