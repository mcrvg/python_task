# create new file named: .gitignore in pycharm
#We want to delete .idea/ folder from our remote repository (GitHub)
TERMINAL
--> git add .
--> git commit -m "Add .gitignore file"

### remove a file you don't want to commit

- .gitignore file = allows anything in the folder to be ignored during a git commit and push
EXAMPLES:
  - eg. sensitive information (personal files, credentials and passwords)
  - very large files or folders that don't need to be pushed
  - folders that build up (bin, out, etc)
  - hidden system files
 
-.idea (your pycharm settings) can be added to .gitignore
  - open a .gitignore repo and add: .idea/
TERMINAL:
--> git rm --cached .idea :Do not remove
-->git rm --cached -r .idea :Now everything inside the folder is deleted
-->git status: changes to be commit
-->git commit -m "Remove .idea folder recursively"
-->git push
##now is gone

Doing that avibe, the file is still available if the push is public as people can just go 
back to previous commit and see that file
# IF YOU PUSH PERSONAL CREDENTIALS ON A PUBLIC REPO TO GITHUB :
  - OPTION 1 "git reset", removes previous commit with that file DANGEROUS - CAN LOSE WORK
  - OPTION 2 
    - remove the GitHub repo IMMEDIATELY (you are now safe)
    - remove the sensitive information from your local repo
    - git remove the commit history, remove the .git folder, you will the latest files, but no history of past commits
